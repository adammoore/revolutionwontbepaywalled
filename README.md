## ❓ WHY THIS MATTERS

**Because:**
- Elsevier makes 37% profit margins (higher than Apple, Google, Microsoft)
- On YOUR unpaid labour (peer review, editing)
- From YOUR publicly funded research
- That YOU then buy back through subscriptions
- While ECRs struggle to afford APCs
- And the Global South can't access knowledge
- And the public can't read research they paid for

**Because:**
- Diamond OA works (JMLR: $6.50/article, Quantum: $489/article)
- The money exists (just misdirected to profits)
- Prestige is something WE create (and can move)
- The system only works because we consent

**Because:**
- The revolution won't be paywalled
- The revolution will be open
- The revolution starts with us

## 🔓 LET'S DO THIS

The knowledge is ours.
The expertise is ours.
The legitimacy is ours.

We've been giving them away. 
We can stop.
