## For Researchers

### Template 1: Resigning from a Commercial Editorial Board

**When to use:** When you've decided to resign from an editorial position at a commercial publisher due to exploitative practices.

**Customization notes:** Add specific financial data about the journal if available. Consider coordinating with other editors for greater impact.

```
Subject: Resignation from Editorial Board of [JOURNAL NAME]

Dear [EDITOR-IN-CHIEF / PUBLISHER CONTACT],

I am writing to formally resign from my position as [POSITION] on the editorial board of [JOURNAL NAME], effective [DATE].

This decision has not been made lightly. I have greatly valued the opportunity to contribute to scholarly discourse in [FIELD] and to work with colleagues whose research I deeply respect. However, I can no longer justify lending my expertise and reputation to a publication model that I believe undermines the scholarly mission we all share.

My concerns are threefold:

1. **Financial exploitation**: [JOURNAL NAME] charges [SUBSCRIPTION PRICE/APC AMOUNT], yet editorial board members receive [PAYMENT AMOUNT OR "no compensation"]. This represents a fundamental misalignment between the value we create and the profits extracted by [PUBLISHER NAME].

2. **Access barriers**: Research published in [JOURNAL NAME] remains behind paywalls that prevent access by researchers in the Global South, independent scholars, and the public whose taxes often funded the research. This contradicts the fundamental purpose of scholarly communication.

3. **Sustainable alternatives exist**: Diamond Open Access journals such as [EXAMPLE IN YOUR FIELD] demonstrate that rigorous peer review and quality publishing can be achieved at a fraction of the cost, without paywalls or APCs.

I believe that our scholarly community has the collective power to create publishing infrastructure that serves researchers rather than shareholders. I encourage [JOURNAL NAME] to transition to a Diamond Open Access model. Should you decide to pursue such a transition, I would be happy to discuss how I might support that effort.

I wish you and the editorial team all the best, and I remain committed to supporting publishing models that genuinely serve the scholarly community.

Sincerely,
[YOUR NAME]
[YOUR TITLE]
[YOUR INSTITUTION]

Optional addition for coordinated resignations:

P.S. I am one of [NUMBER] editorial board members resigning today in coordinated action. A public statement will be released on [DATE], and we are actively working to establish a Diamond Open Access alternative in this field.

### Template 2: Declining an Exploitative Review Request

**When to use:** When declining to review for a journal with high APCs or subscription prices.

**Customization notes:** Keep it brief but principled. The journal may contact you again if they reform their model.

```
Subject: Re: Invitation to Review for [JOURNAL NAME]

Dear [EDITOR NAME],

Thank you for inviting me to review the manuscript "[MANUSCRIPT TITLE]" for [JOURNAL NAME]. I appreciate your confidence in my expertise.

However, I must respectfully decline this invitation. I have adopted a policy of prioritizing my reviewing time for non-profit and Diamond Open Access journals.

After reviewing [JOURNAL NAME]'s publishing model, I note that [it charges authors £[APC AMOUNT] to publish / it charges institutions £[SUBSCRIPTION PRICE] for access / both]. Given that peer review is unpaid labour, I believe this level of commercial extraction is incompatible with the values of scholarly communication.

I would be happy to reconsider if [JOURNAL NAME] transitions to a Diamond Open Access model (free to read, free to publish). In the meantime, I recommend the manuscript be submitted to [ALTERNATIVE DIAMOND OA JOURNAL IN FIELD].

I wish you success in finding an appropriate reviewer.

Best regards,
[YOUR NAME]
[YOUR TITLE]
[YOUR INSTITUTION]

Optional addition:

P.S. If you're interested in learning more about Diamond Open Access alternatives in [FIELD], I recommend visiting [DOAJ.org] or contacting me directly. Many of us are working to build better infrastructure for scholarly publishing.

### Template 3: Encouraging Colleagues to Publish Diamond OA

**When to use:** Email to department, research group, or colleagues explaining why you're choosing Diamond OA venues.

**Customization notes:** Focus on field-specific Diamond OA journals that are well-regarded. Emphasize practical benefits, not just ideology.

```
Subject: Considering Diamond Open Access for Your Next Publication?

Dear Colleagues,

I wanted to share some information about Diamond Open Access publishing that has influenced my recent publication decisions, in case it's useful for others in our department.

**What is Diamond OA?**
Diamond Open Access journals are free to read AND free to publish—no paywalls, no APCs. They're funded by institutions, consortia, or scholarly societies, not by charging authors or readers.

**Why I'm prioritizing Diamond OA:**

1. **Maximum impact**: My research reaches everyone—colleagues in the Global South, independent researchers, practitioners, students, and the public who funded the work.

2. **Ethical alignment**: I'm not comfortable paying £3,000+ APCs or supporting 37% profit margins while doing unpaid peer review.

3. **Quality is excellent**: Journals like [EXAMPLES IN YOUR FIELD] maintain rigorous peer review and are well-respected in our community.

4. **It's good for ECRs**: Our PhD students and postdocs shouldn't have to choose between open access and affording to publish.

**High-quality Diamond OA journals in [FIELD]:**
- [JOURNAL 1] - [URL] - [Brief description, e.g., "Rigorous peer review, 2-3 month turnaround"]
- [JOURNAL 2] - [URL] - [Brief description]
- [JOURNAL 3] - [URL] - [Brief description]

**Find more:** Search for your field at [DOAJ.org] and filter by "No APC".

I'm not suggesting we all immediately stop publishing in commercial venues—career pressures are real. But I do think we should be strategic and intentional about where we send our best work.

The current system only works because we give it our labour, our research, and our legitimacy. We have more power than we think.

Happy to discuss over coffee if anyone wants to chat about this further.

Best,
[YOUR NAME]

### Template 4: Proposing a Diamond OA Alternative Journal

**When to use:** When you want to launch a Diamond OA journal as an alternative to an existing commercial journal.

**Customization notes:** This is for approaching potential co-founders or a learned society. Include preliminary research on costs and infrastructure.

```
Subject: Proposal: Launching a Diamond OA Alternative to [COMMERCIAL JOURNAL]

Dear [COLLEAGUE NAME / SOCIETY PRESIDENT],

I am writing to propose the creation of a new Diamond Open Access journal in [FIELD] as an alternative to the current commercial options, particularly [COMMERCIAL JOURNAL NAME].

**The Problem:**
[COMMERCIAL JOURNAL] charges [SUBSCRIPTION PRICE OR APC AMOUNT] while offering editors [PAYMENT AMOUNT]. This extractive model:
- Limits access to our community's research
- Drains resources from universities and researchers
- Enriches shareholders rather than advancing scholarship

**The Opportunity:**
Successful Diamond OA journals like [EXAMPLE 1] and [EXAMPLE 2] demonstrate that we can:
- Maintain rigorous peer review
- Achieve faster publication times
- Operate at costs of £300-500 per article (vs. £3,000+ for APCs)
- Remain financially sustainable through institutional support

**Proposed Model:**
- **Platform**: Open Journal Systems (free, open-source, used by 10,000+ journals)
- **Hosting**: [YOUR INSTITUTION / CONSORTIUM / SOCIETY]
- **Funding**: [INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT / CONSORTIUM MEMBERSHIP / SOCIETY DUES]
- **Governance**: Scholar-led editorial board with transparent policies
- **Estimated cost**: £[AMOUNT] per year for [EXPECTED ARTICLES] articles

**Editorial Team:**
I have already spoken with [NAMES] who have expressed interest in serving on the founding editorial board. Several are current editors at [COMMERCIAL JOURNAL] and would consider resigning to join this initiative.

**Timeline:**
- Month 1-2: Finalize governance structure and editorial board
- Month 3-4: Set up technical infrastructure
- Month 5-6: Solicit initial submissions
- Month 7+: First issue published

**Next Steps:**
I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this proposal with you and other interested colleagues. Would you be available for a meeting in the next few weeks?

This is not just about creating another journal—it's about demonstrating that our scholarly community can govern itself and build infrastructure that serves knowledge rather than profit.

Best regards,
[YOUR NAME]

## For Librarians

### Template 5: Cancelling or Renegotiating a Big Deal

**When to use:** When proposing to administration that your institution walk away from or aggressively renegotiate a publisher package.

**Customization notes:** Include institution-specific cost data. Reference successful cancellations at peer institutions.

```
Subject: Proposal to Cancel/Renegotiate [PUBLISHER] Big Deal

To: [PROVOST / LIBRARY DIRECTOR / RELEVANT ADMINISTRATOR]

**Executive Summary:**
I propose that [INSTITUTION] terminate (or substantially renegotiate) our subscription agreement with [PUBLISHER] at the next renewal point. Cost analysis demonstrates that we can improve access to research while reducing costs by approximately [£ AMOUNT OR %] annually.

**Current Situation:**
- Annual cost: £[AMOUNT]
- Cost per download: £[AMOUNT]
- Annual price increase: [%]
- Articles by [INSTITUTION] authors published in [PUBLISHER] journals: [NUMBER]

**The Problem:**

1. **Unsustainable costs**: Over the past [X] years, our costs have increased by [%] while our budget has [remained flat/increased by only %].

2. **Poor value**: We're paying £[AMOUNT] per article downloaded. Diamond OA alternatives cost £300-500 per article published.

3. **Double-dipping**: We pay [PUBLISHER] £[APC AMOUNT] to publish + £[SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT] to read back our own research.

4. **Inequitable access**: We're subsidizing a system that excludes researchers at less wealthy institutions.

**Proposed Action:**

**Option 1 - Aggressive Renegotiation:**
- Demand [%] price reduction
- Require a la carte cancellation rights for individual titles
- Cap annual increases at [%]
- Walk away if terms are not met

**Option 2 - Full Cancellation:**
- Cancel the Big Deal effective [DATE]
- Redirect £[AMOUNT] to:
  - Interlibrary loan budget: £[AMOUNT]
  - Institutional repository infrastructure: £[AMOUNT]
  - Diamond OA journal support: £[AMOUNT]
  - Pay-per-view article access: £[AMOUNT]
  - Net savings: £[AMOUNT]

**Supporting Evidence:**

Similar institutions have successfully cancelled and maintained (or improved) access:
- **University of California** (2019): Walked away from Elsevier, maintained research productivity
- **[PEER INSTITUTION 1]**: Cancelled [YEAR], reported [%] decrease in access issues
- **[PEER INSTITUTION 2]**: Renegotiated and saved £[AMOUNT] annually

**Access Mitigation:**

Post-cancellation access strategies:
1. Interlibrary loan (48-72 hour turnaround)
2. Pay-per-view for urgent needs
3. Author preprints (70%+ of articles have free versions)
4. Direct author requests (87% response rate in studies)
5. Enhanced discovery tools for open access alternatives

**Faculty Consultation:**

I recommend forming a faculty advisory group to:
- Review usage data by department
- Identify essential vs. low-use journals
- Explore discipline-specific OA alternatives
- Build support for the transition

**Financial Impact:**

| Scenario | Year 1 Cost | Year 5 Cost | 5-Year Savings |
|----------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Status quo | £[AMOUNT] | £[AMOUNT] | £0 |
| Renegotiation | £[AMOUNT] | £[AMOUNT] | £[AMOUNT] |
| Cancellation | £[AMOUNT] | £[AMOUNT] | £[AMOUNT] |

**Timeline:**

- [DATE]: Present proposal to library committee
- [DATE]: Consult with faculty advisory group
- [DATE]: Notify [PUBLISHER] of non-renewal (or renegotiation demands)
- [DATE]: Implement transition plan
- [DATE]: Big Deal ends / New agreement begins

**Recommendation:**

I recommend **[Option 1 / Option 2]** based on [RATIONALE]. This approach balances our commitment to faculty research needs with our responsibility to manage costs sustainably and support equitable knowledge infrastructure.

I am prepared to lead the transition effort and work closely with faculty to ensure minimal disruption.

Respectfully submitted,

### Template 7: Transparency Report to Faculty

**When to use:** When sharing subscription cost data with faculty to build support for reform.

**Customization notes:** Include discipline-specific data. Frame it as information-sharing, not advocacy (initially).

```
Subject: 2025 Scholarly Publishing Costs: Transparency Report

Dear Faculty,

As part of the library's commitment to transparency, I'm sharing our annual scholarly publishing costs report. This data may be useful as you make decisions about where to publish and peer review.

**Overall Spending (2024):**
- Total: £[AMOUNT]
- Average annual increase: [%] over past 5 years
- Percentage of total library budget: [%]

**Top 5 Publishers:**

| Publisher | Annual Cost | Cost per Download | # Downloads | Articles by [INSTITUTION] Authors |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| [Publisher 1] | £[AMOUNT] | £[AMOUNT] | [NUMBER] | [NUMBER] |
| [Publisher 2] | £[AMOUNT] | £[AMOUNT] | [NUMBER] | [NUMBER] |
| [Publisher 3] | £[AMOUNT] | £[AMOUNT] | [NUMBER] | [NUMBER] |
| [Publisher 4] | £[AMOUNT] | £[AMOUNT] | [NUMBER] | [NUMBER] |
| [Publisher 5] | £[AMOUNT] | £[AMOUNT] | [NUMBER] | [NUMBER] |

**Comparison:**
- Average cost per article via Big Deal subscription: £[AMOUNT]
- Average cost per article via ILL: £[AMOUNT]
- Average cost per article at Diamond OA journals: £300-500
- Average APC charged to [INSTITUTION] authors: £[AMOUNT]

**"Double Dipping":**
In 2024, [INSTITUTION] paid:
- £[AMOUNT] in APCs to publish our research in [PUBLISHER] journals
- £[AMOUNT] in subscriptions to access those same journals
- **Total**: £[AMOUNT] to [PUBLISHER] alone

**Open Access Alternatives:**

The following Diamond OA journals (free to read, free to publish) served [NUMBER] of our faculty last year:
- [JOURNAL 1] - [FIELD] - [# AUTHORS]
- [JOURNAL 2] - [FIELD] - [# AUTHORS]
- [JOURNAL 3] - [FIELD] - [# AUTHORS]

Find Diamond OA journals in your field: [DOAJ.org] (filter by "No APC")

**What This Means:**

I'm not suggesting we cancel everything tomorrow. But this data raises important questions:
- Are we getting good value for these costs?
- Could we reallocate funds to better support research?
- What role should [INSTITUTION] play in building sustainable alternatives?

**Next Steps:**

The library is exploring options for the 2026 renewal cycle, including:
- Renegotiating Big Deals with stricter terms
- Cancelling low-value packages
- Redirecting savings to open infrastructure and Diamond OA support

I welcome your input. If you have thoughts on priorities, concerns about access, or interest in Diamond OA alternatives, please reach out.

## For Administrators

### Template 8: Institutional Open Access Policy

**When to use:** When proposing a formal OA policy for your institution.

**Customization notes:** Adapt to align with existing institutional policies. Consider phased implementation.

```
DRAFT POLICY PROPOSAL

**[INSTITUTION NAME] Open Access Policy**

**Effective Date:** [DATE]
**Policy Owner:** [OFFICE/POSITION]
**Review Date:** [DATE]

---

**1. Purpose**

This policy affirms [INSTITUTION]'s commitment to the broadest possible access to research outputs produced by its community. It establishes expectations for open access to publications and data, aligning with our mission of knowledge creation and public service.

**2. Scope**

This policy applies to all research articles authored or co-authored by [FACULTY / ALL RESEARCHERS] during their employment or affiliation with [INSTITUTION], accepted for publication on or after [DATE].

**3. Policy Statement**

[INSTITUTION] faculty and researchers will make their peer-reviewed research articles openly accessible by:

### Template 9: Research Assessment Reform

**When to use:** When proposing that your institution adopt DORA principles or reform promotion/tenure criteria.

**Customization notes:** This is sensitive—work closely with faculty governance. Emphasize that this benefits early-career researchers.

```
Subject: Proposal to Reform Research Assessment Criteria

To: [PROVOST / TENURE COMMITTEE / FACULTY SENATE]

**Purpose:**
Propose that [INSTITUTION] adopt evidence-based research assessment practices that do not rely on journal brand or impact factors, in alignment with DORA (Declaration on Research Assessment).

**Current Problem:**

Our current assessment practices create perverse incentives:

1. **Journal prestige ≠ research quality**: Impact factors measure journal citations, not individual article quality. They're easily gamed and statistically flawed.

2. **Discrimination against Diamond OA**: Early-career researchers avoid excellent Diamond OA journals because they fear they "don't count" for promotion.

3. **Reinforces commercial power**: We're incentivizing publication in venues that charge £3,000+ APCs or exclude researchers without subscriptions.

4. **Misaligned with values**: [INSTITUTION]'s mission emphasizes [PUBLIC SERVICE / ACCESS / EQUITY], yet our assessment criteria reward exclusivity.

**Evidence:**

- **20,000+ organizations** have signed DORA, including [PEER INSTITUTIONS]
- **Multiple studies** show no correlation between journal impact factor and article citations
- **[FUNDER]** explicitly prohibits use of impact factors in grant proposals
- **Case studies** from [EXAMPLES] show successful implementation with no loss of quality

**Proposed Changes:**

**Current Practice → Reformed Practice**

| Area | Current | Proposed |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Promotion criteria** | "Publish in high-impact journals" | "Demonstrate research impact through citations, usage, adoption, etc." |
| **Tenure letters** | Mention journal prestige | Focus on research contribution and methodology |
| **Annual reviews** | Count publications by journal tier | Assess research quality, citations, real-world impact |
| **Hiring** | "Nature/Science pubs preferred" | "Strong publication record in appropriate venues" |

**Specific Policy Language:**

> "[INSTITUTION] evaluates research on its own merits rather than on the basis of the journal in which it is published. We do not use journal impact factors or publisher reputation as a surrogate for research quality. Faculty are encouraged to publish in venues most appropriate for their research and audience, including Diamond Open Access journals."

**Implementation Plan:**

**Year 1:**
- Sign DORA as an institution
- Update promotion and tenure guidelines
- Faculty development workshops on article-level metrics
- Communicate changes to all departments

**Year 2:**
- Update appointment letter templates
- Train tenure review committees
- Remove journal prestige language from all official documents
- Monitor implementation

**Year 3:**
- Review and assess impact
- Gather faculty feedback
- Refine as needed

**Benefits:**

**For Early-Career Researchers:**
- Freedom to publish in optimal venues without career risk
- Reduced pressure to pay high APCs
- Evaluation based on their work, not journal brand

**For [INSTITUTION]:**
- Alignment with leading research institutions
- Support for open access and equity
- Reputation as forward-thinking in research assessment

**For Research Quality:**
- Incentivizes publishing for appropriate audience, not prestige
- Reduces gaming of metrics
- Focuses on actual research contribution

**Addressing Concerns:**

**"Won't this reduce our prestige?"**
- No. Our prestige comes from the quality of our research, not where it's published.
- Leading institutions (MIT, Caltech, Cambridge) have adopted DORA.

**"How will we judge quality without impact factors?"**
- Read the research. Assess methodology, contribution, citations.
- Article-level metrics, when needed (with caution).
- External review letters focused on research, not venue.

**"This will take more time."**
- Initial transition requires effort, but subsequent reviews are more meaningful.
- We already read tenure files carefully—this simply removes a misleading shortcut.

**Comparison with Peer Institutions:**

| Institution | DORA Signatory | Policy Changes | Outcome |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| [PEER 1] | Yes (20XX) | Removed IF from all criteria | "More diverse, higher-quality pubs" |
| [PEER 2] | Yes (20XX) | Explicit OA encouragement | "Increased research visibility" |
| [PEER 3] | Yes (20XX) | Banned IF in promotion files | "No loss of quality or reputation" |

**Next Steps:**

1. Present to Faculty Senate for discussion
2. Form working group to draft specific policy language
3. Consult with departments on discipline-specific concerns
4. Vote on policy adoption
5. Sign DORA as an institution

**Recommendation:**

I recommend that [INSTITUTION] sign DORA and implement the proposed assessment reforms beginning in [ACADEMIC YEAR]. This positions us as leaders in research integrity and open scholarship.

I welcome discussion and am available to present to relevant committees.

### Template 10: Supporting Institutional Publishing

**When to use:** When proposing that your institution invest in hosting its own Diamond OA journals or press.

**Customization notes:** Include examples of peer institutions with successful programs. Address sustainability concerns.

```
Subject: Proposal to Establish [INSTITUTION] Diamond Open Access Publishing Program

To: [PROVOST / PRESIDENT / RELEVANT ADMINISTRATOR]

**Executive Summary:**

I propose that [INSTITUTION] establish an institutional publishing program to host Diamond Open Access journals (free to read, free to publish) in fields where our faculty are leaders. This initiative would:
- Cost £[AMOUNT] annually (less than [%] of current subscription budget)
- Support [NUMBER] journals in first 3 years
- Position [INSTITUTION] as a leader in sustainable scholarly communication
- Provide immediate, global access to research produced here

**Strategic Rationale:**

**1. Mission Alignment**
[INSTITUTION]'s mission emphasizes [PUBLIC SERVICE / KNOWLEDGE CREATION / ACCESS]. Hosting Diamond OA journals directly advances this mission by removing barriers to research.

**2. Financial Sustainability**
We currently pay £[AMOUNT] annually to commercial publishers. Redirecting a fraction of this to self-publishing would:
- Reduce long-term costs
- Retain control over our research
- Build assets rather than renting access

**3. Research Leadership**
Our faculty are already editorial leaders in [FIELD 1], [FIELD 2], and [FIELD 3]. Hosting journals here would:
- Recognize and support their editorial work
- Attract high-quality submissions
- Increase [INSTITUTION]'s visibility

**4. Peer Institutions**
[NUMBER] peer institutions already host Diamond OA journals:
- [PEER 1]: [NUMBER] journals, [NOTABLE EXAMPLE]
- [PEER 2]: [EXAMPLE]
- [PEER 3]: [EXAMPLE]

**Proposed Model:**

**Infrastructure:**
- **Platform**: Open Journal Systems (PKP)—free, open-source, used by 10,000+ journals worldwide
- **Hosting**: Library IT infrastructure
- **Support**: 1.5 FTE staff (technical + editorial support)
- **Training**: PKP provides free training resources

**Governance:**
- Faculty-led editorial boards
- Library provides technical infrastructure and publishing support
- Clear MOU between institution and journals
- Editorial independence maintained

**Cost Analysis:**

**Startup Costs (Year 1):**
- Technical infrastructure setup: £[AMOUNT]
- Staff hiring/training: £[AMOUNT]
- Platform customization: £[AMOUNT]
- Marketing/launch: £[AMOUNT]
- **Total Year 1**: £[AMOUNT]

**Annual Operating Costs (Years 2+):**
- Staff salaries (1.5 FTE): £[AMOUNT]
- Server hosting: £[AMOUNT]
- Platform maintenance: £[AMOUNT]
- Support services: £[AMOUNT]
- **Total Annual**: £[AMOUNT]

**Cost per article** (assuming [NUMBER] articles/year by Year 3): £[AMOUNT]

**Compare to:**
- Commercial subscription cost per article: £[AMOUNT]
- Commercial APC: £[AMOUNT]

**Initial Journals (Target for Years 1-3):**

1. **[JOURNAL NAME 1]** - [FIELD]
   - Current editor: [NAME], [INSTITUTION] faculty
   - Currently published by [COMMERCIAL PUBLISHER] at [APC/SUBSCRIPTION]
   - Willing to migrate to Diamond OA model

2. **[JOURNAL NAME 2]** - [FIELD]
   - New journal, founding editors at [INSTITUTION]
   - Gap in current Diamond OA landscape for [TOPIC]

3. **[JOURNAL NAME 3]** - [FIELD]
   - Existing independent journal seeking institutional home
   - Strong reputation, needs sustainability model

**Implementation Timeline:**

| Quarter | Activity |
|---------|----------|
| Q1 | Hire staff, set up infrastructure, train teams |
| Q2 | Launch first journal (soft launch) |
| Q3 | Refine processes, market journal, solicit submissions |
| Q4 | Launch second journal, assess Year 1 |
| Year 2 | Scale to 3-5 journals, expand staff as needed |
| Year 3 | Evaluate sustainability, plan expansion or stabilization |

**Success Metrics:**

**Year 1:**
- 1-2 journals launched
- [NUMBER] articles published
- Platform operational with 99%+ uptime

**Year 3:**
- 3-5 journals hosted
- [NUMBER] articles published
- International submissions from top researchers
- Cost per article below £[AMOUNT]

**Year 5:**
- 5-10 journals
- Recognized model for institutional publishing
- Self-sustaining through combination of institutional support and consortium partnerships

**Risk Mitigation:**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Journal quality concerns | Rigorous peer review, experienced editors, transparent policies |
| Sustainability | Start small, scale based on success, diversify funding |
| Faculty buy-in | Extensive consultation, start with enthusiastic champions |
| Technical challenges | Use proven platform (OJS), partner with PKP community |
| Competing with established journals | Focus on underserved niches, emphasize mission over profit |

**Support from Peer Institutions:**

I have contacted colleagues at [PEER INSTITUTIONS] with similar programs. They report:
- "[QUOTE about success]" - [NAME], [INSTITUTION]
- "[QUOTE about challenges overcome]" - [NAME], [INSTITUTION]
- "[QUOTE about faculty response]" - [NAME], [INSTITUTION]

All offered to serve as advisors during our setup phase.

**Faculty Consultation:**

Initial conversations with [NAMES] indicate strong interest. A formal survey of department heads could identify additional opportunities.

**Alignment with Strategic Plan:**

This proposal directly supports [INSTITUTION]'s strategic priorities:
- **[PRIORITY 1]**: Diamond OA increases research visibility and impact
- **[PRIORITY 2]**: Demonstrates leadership in scholarly communication
- **[PRIORITY 3]**: Efficient use of resources, building assets not renting access

**Budget Request:**

I request:
1. **Year 1**: £[AMOUNT] for startup costs
2. **Years 2-5**: £[AMOUNT] annually for operations
3. **Authorization** to form faculty advisory committee
4. **Approval** to proceed with staff hiring and infrastructure setup

**Expected Outcome:**

By Year 5, [INSTITUTION] will:
- Host 5-10 high-quality Diamond OA journals
- Publish [NUMBER]+ articles annually
- Be recognized as a leader in sustainable scholarly publishing
- Save approximately £[AMOUNT] compared to continued subscription model

This is not just about publishing—it's about institutional self-determination and aligning our infrastructure with our values.

I welcome the opportunity to discuss this proposal in detail.

## For Students & ECRs

### Template 11: Requesting OA Guidance from Supervisor

**When to use:** When you want to discuss open access options with your supervisor but don't want to seem confrontational.

**Customization notes:** Frame it as seeking advice, not challenging authority. Adapt tone to your relationship.

```
Subject: Question about Open Access Options for My Research

Dear [SUPERVISOR NAME],

I hope this email finds you well. I've been thinking about publication strategy for my [dissertation chapter / paper] on [TOPIC], and I wanted to get your advice on open access options.

I've been reading about Diamond Open Access journals (free to read and free to publish), and I'm wondering if they might be a good fit for this work. I found a few that seem relevant:

- [JOURNAL 1] - [Brief note on why it's relevant]
- [JOURNAL 2] - [Brief note]
- [JOURNAL 3] - [Brief note]

I'm particularly interested in Diamond OA because:
1. My work would be immediately accessible to researchers who don't have institutional subscriptions
2. I wouldn't need to find funding for APCs
3. Some of these journals have quick turnaround times

That said, I know that publication venue matters for career prospects, and I don't want to jeopardize my future by publishing somewhere that won't be respected.

**Questions for you:**
- Are you familiar with any of these journals? Do they have good reputations in our field?
- Do you think publishing in Diamond OA venues would hurt my career prospects?
- Are there other Diamond OA journals you'd recommend I look at?
- Would it make sense to aim for a Diamond OA journal for this paper and save [PRESTIGIOUS JOURNAL] for my stronger papers?

I'd really value your perspective on this. I'm also happy to discuss over coffee if that's easier than email.

Thank you for your guidance!

Best,
[YOUR NAME]

### Template 12: Proposing an OA Working Group

**When to use:** When you want to organize graduate students or ECRs to learn about and advocate for open access.

**Customization notes:** Keep initial goals modest and educational rather than activist to build support.

```
Subject: Interested in Starting a Grad Student Open Access Group?

Dear [GRAD STUDENTS / ECRS / COLLEAGUES],

I'm interested in starting an informal working group focused on open access publishing—specifically learning about Diamond Open Access options in our fields and supporting each other in navigating publication decisions.

**Why this matters:**

As early-career researchers, we face:
- Pressure to publish in "prestigious" journals (often behind paywalls)
- Limited funding for APCs if we want to publish open access
- Uncertainty about which OA journals are respected
- Concerns about how publication venue affects career prospects

Meanwhile, there are excellent Diamond OA journals (free to read, free to publish) in most fields, but they're not always well-known.

**Proposed Activities:**

**Short-term (first semester):**
- Monthly informal meetings (coffee/lunch)
- Build a shared resource: "Diamond OA journals in our fields"
- Invite library OA specialist to present
- Share experiences and advice

**Medium-term (if there's interest):**
- Invite speakers on scholarly communication
- Workshop on navigating publisher agreements
- Compile guidelines for our field
- Possibly present findings to department

**Long-term (aspirational):**
- Advocate for institutional OA policies that support ECRs
- Work with library on improving OA resources
- Connect with similar groups at other universities

**Not this group's purpose:**
- Pressuring anyone to publish in specific venues
- Creating more work for already-stressed grad students
- Activist campaigning (we're here to learn and support each other)

**First Meeting (Proposed):**
- **Date**: [DATE]
- **Time**: [TIME]
- **Location**: [LOCATION / ZOOM]
- **Agenda**:
  - Introductions
  - What do we want to learn?
  - Share current knowledge about OA
  - Plan next steps (only if there's interest!)

**RSVP:**
Let me know if you're interested and can make the first meeting. No pressure—just curious if there's enough interest to make this worthwhile.

If you can't make it but want to stay informed, let me know and I'll add you to the email list.

**Resources to check out (optional):**
- Directory of Open Access Journals: https://doaj.org (filter by "No APC")
- The Revolution Won't Be Paywalled: https://bit.ly/_TRWBP_
- [INSTITUTION] Library OA Guide: [URL if available]

Looking forward to hearing if this resonates with anyone!

Best,
[YOUR NAME]
[YOUR PROGRAM/DEPARTMENT]
[YOUR EMAIL]

P.S. This is a student-led initiative—not affiliated with any organization or publisher. Just trying to figure this out together!
