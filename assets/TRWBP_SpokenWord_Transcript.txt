The revolution won't be paywalled
Adam Vials Moore
November 2025

You will not be able to access the research, brothers and sisters,
Because your library cancelled the subscription.

You did the research with your own hands,
You reviewed the papers for free,
You edited the journal for nothing,
And then they charged you thousands to publish,
Millions to read it back.

This isn't a publishing model.
This is extraction.
This is capitalism in a white coat.

The revolution won't be paywalled.

The revolution will not be brought to you by Elsevier,
Springer, Wiley, Taylor & Francis—
The publishers who make more profit than tech giants
While paying scholars nothing.

The revolution won't be paywalled, brothers and sisters.
The revolution won't have an article processing charge.
The revolution won't require institutional access.

The revolution will be Diamond Open Access.
The revolution will be scholar-governed.
The revolution will be knowledge as a commons, not a commodity.

You cannot stay home and publish in Nature and ignore the system.
Because the system is broken,
And your students can't afford it,
And the Global South can't access it,
And the public can't read the research they paid for.

The revolution will be editorial boards walking out.
The revolution will be libraries cancelling big deals.
The revolution will be scholars taking back what's ours.

The knowledge is ours.
The expertise is ours.
The legitimacy is ours.

We've been giving them away.
We can stop.

The revolution won't be paywalled.
The revolution will be open.

And it starts now.
