00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The revolution won't be paywalled
Adam Vials Moore, November 2025

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You will not be able to access
the research, brothers and sisters,

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,500
Because your library
cancelled the subscription.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You did the research
with your own hands,

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,000
You reviewed the papers for free,

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,500
You edited the journal for nothing,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And then they charged you
thousands to publish,

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,500
Millions to read it back.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This isn't a publishing model.

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,500
This is extraction.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This is capitalism
in a white coat.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The revolution won't be paywalled.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The revolution will not be brought
to you by Elsevier,

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,000
Springer, Wiley, Taylor & Francis—

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,000
The publishers who make more profit
than tech giants

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,000
While paying scholars nothing.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The revolution won't be paywalled,
brothers and sisters.

18
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,000
The revolution won't have
an article processing charge.

19
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,500
The revolution won't require
institutional access.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,500
The revolution will be
Diamond Open Access.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The revolution will be
scholar-governed.

22
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,000
The revolution will be knowledge
as a commons, not a commodity.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You cannot stay home and publish
in Nature and ignore the system.

24
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,000
Because the system is broken,

25
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,000
And your students can't afford it,

26
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,000
And the Global South
can't access it,

27
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,500
And the public can't read
the research they paid for.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The revolution will be
editorial boards walking out.

29
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,000
The revolution will be
libraries cancelling big deals.

30
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,500
The revolution will be
scholars taking back what's ours.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,500
The knowledge is ours.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,500
The expertise is ours.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,500
The legitimacy is ours.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We've been giving them away.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,500
We can stop.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,500
The revolution won't be paywalled.

37
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,000
The revolution will be open.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And it starts now.
