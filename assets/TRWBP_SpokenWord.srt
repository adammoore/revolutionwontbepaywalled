00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,868
The revolution won't be paywalled
Adam Vials Moore, November 2025

2
00:00:04,642 --> 00:00:07,737
You will not be able to access
the research, brothers and sisters,

3
00:00:08,124 --> 00:00:10,445
Because your library
cancelled the subscription.

4
00:00:11,606 --> 00:00:13,927
You did the research
with your own hands,

5
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:16,248
You reviewed the papers for free,

6
00:00:16,635 --> 00:00:18,956
You edited the journal for nothing,

7
00:00:19,343 --> 00:00:21,664
And then they charged you
thousands to publish,

8
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:24,372
Millions to read it back.

9
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:27,854
This isn't a publishing model.

10
00:00:28,241 --> 00:00:29,788
This is extraction.

11
00:00:30,175 --> 00:00:32,496
This is capitalism
in a white coat.

12
00:00:34,044 --> 00:00:37,139
The revolution won't be paywalled.

13
00:00:38,686 --> 00:00:41,781
The revolution will not be brought
to you by Elsevier,

14
00:00:42,168 --> 00:00:44,876
Springer, Wiley, Taylor & Francis—

15
00:00:45,263 --> 00:00:47,971
The publishers who make more profit
than tech giants

16
00:00:48,358 --> 00:00:50,292
While paying scholars nothing.

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,935
The revolution won't be paywalled,
brothers and sisters.

18
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:58,030
The revolution won't have
an article processing charge.

19
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:00,738
The revolution won't require
institutional access.

20
00:01:01,898 --> 00:01:04,606
The revolution will be
Diamond Open Access.

21
00:01:04,993 --> 00:01:07,314
The revolution will be
scholar-governed.

22
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:11,183
The revolution will be knowledge
as a commons, not a commodity.

23
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:15,825
You cannot stay home and publish
in Nature and ignore the system.

24
00:01:16,212 --> 00:01:18,147
Because the system is broken,

25
00:01:18,534 --> 00:01:20,468
And your students can't afford it,

26
00:01:20,855 --> 00:01:23,563
And the Global South
can't access it,

27
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,045
And the public can't read
the research they paid for.

28
00:01:28,205 --> 00:01:31,300
The revolution will be
editorial boards walking out.

29
00:01:31,687 --> 00:01:34,395
The revolution will be
libraries cancelling big deals.

30
00:01:34,782 --> 00:01:37,877
The revolution will be
scholars taking back what's ours.

31
00:01:39,037 --> 00:01:40,972
The knowledge is ours.

32
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:43,293
The expertise is ours.

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,614
The legitimacy is ours.

34
00:01:46,775 --> 00:01:49,096
We've been giving them away.

35
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,804
We can stop.

36
00:01:52,965 --> 00:01:55,673
The revolution won't be paywalled.

37
00:01:56,446 --> 00:01:58,381
The revolution will be open.

38
00:01:59,928 --> 00:02:02,250
And it starts now.
